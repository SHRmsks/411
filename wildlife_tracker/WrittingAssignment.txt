1. As a conservative git user that has never seen Gigglegit before, I want to   
   have a more intuitive and intriguing version control so that i don't have to remember the tedious
   formula to implement. 

    As a team lead onboarding an experienced GiggleGit user, I want to have a more relaxing and easygoing 
   version control that minimize the frustrates the merges.

2. As a school professor, I want to have a version control that can attact students to learn 
    easier so that I don't have to print out cheatsheet for them.

    ticket1: complete feasibility 
    Details: Each memes must stand for different functionality respectly, and they are 
    meaningful of their roles.
    ticket2: implement safety 
    Details: We need implement a data encripted hash system for storing factors of each 
    version changes, so it will not cause data leak. 


3. Because it lacks the specific goal, clarity and motivation.
    It's a client's requirement instead of user's story
